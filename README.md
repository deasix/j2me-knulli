# Knulli J2ME Support for RG35XX (H700)

Add **J2ME** support to [Knulli](https://knulli.org/) using [freej2me](https://github.com/hex007/freej2me) retroarch core. Personally tested on **RG35XX H** but *expected* to work on other **H700** family of devices running [Batocera](https://batocera.org/) based OS.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/deasix/j2me-knulli/releases/latest)
2. Put in your `/userdata/roms/ports` folder.
3. Run on your device and wait. Device will reboot.
4. Add your `jar` to `/userdata/roms/j2me`.
5. Start playing!
